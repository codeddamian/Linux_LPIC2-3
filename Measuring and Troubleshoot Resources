CPU and Memory Utilization using Io Stat & SAR
Memory utilization using free & VMSTAT
IO Step - SAR & LSOF to talk about disk I/O
Netstat to talk about netstat I/O and bandwidth
Talking about the process and figuring out what's running on the system and where - PS - PStree and Top 
Looking at user Info - i.e who logged into the system and what they are doing - W 
System availability - uptime shows how long the system has been up and how many users and the system load average for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes. 
To find out what packages provides a package binary - yum provides */<packagename>
Measuring & Troubleshooting 
   - iostat command  { iostat -c 2  5} - to show the CPU or disk ( -d ) utilization every twosec five times 
   - sar command - used to collect, report or save system activity.   use sar -d # ls -l /dev | grep "dev202, *" 

To enable a service use -> chconfig sysstat on 

Measuring & Troubleshooting resources usage: 
 - free command - show us memory usage 
 - vmstat command - shows memory usage {virtuall memeory statistics}
- disk information using lsof command - lsof -u user {chekcing the lsof of a particiilar users to get the disk i/o info }

Process management. 
ps command, ps -e, ps -ef, 
pstree, pstree -A, pstree -h -p ,pstree -h -p -a 
top - keyboars hsortcut to change the behaviour - L to remove load average -M memoery - (add/remove columns -F) -B key add ( top 5 process running press n and the number 5 ), K - press K to kill 

Network & Bandwith utilization
netstat- to display your routing table 
netstat -r  #shows static table, default gateway
netstat -s  #from a protocl perspective
netstat -l<t(cp)><u(dp)> #listening connection - tcp cnnection listening for ssh
netstat -ln #not to do reverse dns. woud like to see the ip
netstat -c #conitnuious update 

User information 
w command

Other Commands - Resources usages
iotop - while top shows memory and cpu usage, IOtop shows disk usage -{thread id, Priority{Idle,Best Effort & Real Time}, Disk read& write, SWAP, IO -% in min a cpu is waiting to access the disk.
htop - performance issues
ss - replaced with netstat 
iptraf - network stat tool
